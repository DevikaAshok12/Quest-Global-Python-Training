2.Tell about "file" argument in print method.
     The print function in Python has a file argument that allows you to redirect the output to a file or any file-like object,
     rather than displaying it on the standard output (usually the console).
3. How do we round off to nearest close value
   floor() It removes/truncates the decimal part if any.
   round() If the decimal part is 0.5 or more then next integer number is returned, else the decimal part is truncated.
   ciel() Returns the next integer number if the decimal part of the number is anything other than .0
    So ciel(7.000001) is 8.
