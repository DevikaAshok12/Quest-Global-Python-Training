2.Tell about "file" argument in print method.
     The print function in Python has a file argument that allows you to redirect the output to a file or any file-like object,
     rather than displaying it on the standard output (usually the console).
3. How do we round off to nearest close value
     round() - rounds the number to next integer if decimal value is above 0.5 else rounds to previous integer.
     ceil() - returns next integer value if decimal value is anything greater that 0.0
     floor() - returns the previous integer value
